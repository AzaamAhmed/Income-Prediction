# Income Prediction - Machine Learning Project

## Objective

The goal of this project is to predict whether an individual's income exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., $50,000 per year) based on demographic and employment-related attributes. We will use the Adult Income dataset, commonly referred to as the "Census Income" dataset.

## Dataset

The Adult Income dataset contains approximately 48,842 records, with attributes such as age, education, occupation, and more. Each record is labeled with the income category, either `<=50K` or `>50K`.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Collection

- Obtain the dataset from the kaggle Adult sources.
- Load the data into a Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.

### 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- Explore the dataset to understand its structure and identify any missing or inconsistent data.
- Perform data cleaning, such as handling missing values and removing duplicates.
- Convert categorical variables into numerical ones using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Normalize or scale numerical features if necessary.

### 3. Data Visualization

- Use visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze the distribution of features and the relationship between them.
- Visualize the class distribution to check for imbalances.

### 4. Feature Selection

- Identify the most relevant features for predicting income using techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance from tree-based models.

### 5. Model Selection and Training

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Choose several machine learning algorithms to evaluate, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Train each model on the training data and evaluate performance using cross-validation.

### 6. Model Evaluation

- Evaluate the models on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Use confusion matrices to gain insights into model performance on different classes.

### 7. Hyperparameter Tuning

- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.

### 8. Model Deployment

- Choose the best-performing model and save it using joblib or pickle for later use.
- Optionally, create a simple user interface or API to make predictions on new data.

### 9. Documentation and Reporting

- Document the entire process, including data exploration, preprocessing steps, model selection, evaluation, and results.
- Provide insights and recommendations based on the model's performance.
